# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the [Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://gist.github.com/ComcastOSS/a7b8933dd8e368535378cda25c92d19a).

If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request. Alternatively, we can send you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us. Please create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to contribute, please first search the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Comcast/pulsar-client-go/issues) to ensure the contribution has not already been addressed. If no related issue exists,
please create one describing the intended changes. This is to allow discussing before dedicating additional time, and also to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors interested in the same thing.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify it.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.

* Please include appropriate unit and/or integration tests for any changes.

## Thanks

Your interest in the project is appreciated :heart:.
